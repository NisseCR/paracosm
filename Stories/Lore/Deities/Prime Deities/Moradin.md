![[Moradin E.png]]
Moradin is worshiped by smiths, artisans, and miners alike, granting inspiration in exchange for respect and prayer. He shaped the mountains from the chaos of [[The Founding]], and stands as the patron protector of home and family. The devotion to the All-Hammer is strongest in [[Dwarves|dwarven]] communities, and many temples to Moradin mark the centre of a mighty dwarven stronghold.

Moradin lords over the soul forges within the massive tunnelled mansion of [[Erackinor]], deep beneath the slopes of [[Solonia]] on the plane of [[Mount Celestia|Celestia]].
## Depiction
Many guild halls and workshops contain images of Moradin, a faceless, stout dwarven being of immense strength, hunched over a flaming heart clasped within his massive hands.
## Holy Day
Moradin's holy day is [[Deep Solace]], which is celebrated on the eighteenth day of the fifth month. Especially devout followers of the All-Hammer spend the day in isolation, meditating on the meaning of family and how they may be better mothers, fathers, siblings, and children. The dwarven community in [[Grimgolir]] celebrates with a full day of feasting and drinking.
## Commandments
- Remain stoic and tenacious in the face of catastrophe.
- Uphold and promote loyalty to your family, loyalty to your clan, and loyalty to your people.
- Legacy is paramount. To create something that lasts is to change the world for the better.
