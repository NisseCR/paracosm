## Description
The fingers of this dark silver ear cuff move to gently hold onto your ear.
## Effect
While wearing it, undead creatures can always understand the literal meaning of any language that you speak. In addition, you gain 3 temporary hit points whenever a living creature within 30 feet of you is slain. You can gain these temporary hit points even when you have 0 hit points: when you do, you're immediately stabilized, but are still unconscious.
## Curse
None
