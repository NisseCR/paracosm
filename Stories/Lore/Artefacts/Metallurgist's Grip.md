>_Wondrous item, very rare (requires **attunement**)_
## Description
This plated metal gauntlet extends up your arm. The armoured plates are extensively corroded. If you're missing a hand or arm, the item can function as a prosthesis for it. While you're attuned to the gauntlet, it can't be removed from you against your will, and you have resistance to acid damage.
## Effect
While wearing the gauntlet or using it as a prosthesis, you gain the following properties.

_**Absorb Acid.**_ You can use your reaction whenever you take acid damage to reduce the acid damage you take by 2d6 + 3. When you do, the next melee weapon attack you make before the end of your next turn deals extra acid damage equal to the acid damage it reduced.

_**Caustic Overdrive.**_ You can use a bonus action to cast the _haste_ spell on yourself from the gauntlet. When you do, the spell doesn't require concentration, and you must roll a d6 at the end of each of your turns. You take acid damage equal to the result of the d6, which can't be prevented or reduced in any way. On a 1, the spell ends. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
## Curse
None
