![[Cloak of Smoke and Cinder.png]]
>[!info]
>_Wondrous item, very rare (requires **attunement**)_
## Description
This short, hooded mantle is in threadbare tatters after being burned in a magical fire. While wearing it, the embers of that fire still burn, and plumes of smoke drape downward to replace the parts of the cloak that were lost.
## Effect
While wearing the cloak, you have resistance to fire damage and ignore any penalties that come as a result of a target being obscured by smoke. It also functions as a _cape of the mountebank_.

Whenever another creature hits you with an attack on its turn while you're wearing the cloak, a cloud of smoke billows outward from the cloak, which heavily obscures you and the area around you in a 10-foot-radius sphere. The smoke vanishes at the end of the turn; a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) also disperses the smoke. This property is suppressed while you are incapacitated, restrained, or otherwise unable to move, as well as while you're in an area of moderate or greater wind.
## Curse
None
