>_Wondrous item, uncommon_
## Description
The iron lantern perpetually emits an ethereal vapour that quickly dissipates. It dims the blue light that radiates from the lantern, its radiance inferior to that of an ordinary lantern.

Looking through the gothic glass embellishment will only reveal a thick mist from within. It is hard to ascertain what is exactly held within the lantern.
## Effect
This lantern emits a cold blue light in a 20 ft. radius. If you shine this lantern on deceased remains for 1 minute, you can cause ghostly illusions of the the dead to manifest.
These illusions hover above the remains and act out the last 5 minutes of the creature's life. This effect is silent and shows the dead as they were in life, depicting any items they carried. It does not however reveal any others who may have been present at the time of the creature's death.
## Curse
The wearer is obsessed with the light, refusing to dim or cover it. If the wearer finds themselves in a dimly-lit or heavily obscured area *without the lantern emitting light*, they will be affected by a **short-term madness** effect.
