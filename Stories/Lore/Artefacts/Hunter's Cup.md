## Description
This wooden goblet is covered in a soft layer of moss. Three twisted antlers encircle it. It holds 1 cup of liquid.
## Effect
When the goblet is filled from a free-flowing stream or pond, it begins to glow with a soft energy. Drinking the full goblet of glowing water using an action grants you the following benefits until you finish a short or long rest (to a maximum of 24 hours):

- You gain a +2 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and Wisdom checks.
- You gain a +2 bonus to the damage rolls of your ranged weapon attacks.
- Your walking speed increases by 5 feet.
- Any bonus granted by the goblet is doubled while you're within a forest.

The water in the goblet ceases to glow after 24 hours or if it's moved more than 100 feet away from where it was filled. Once a creature has drunk from the goblet in this way, it can't be used again until 1d4 days have passed.
## Curse
None
