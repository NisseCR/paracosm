![[Astryn Full.jpg]]

>[!quote]
>_Fully wayshadowed, three-titled and nameless._

Astryn is a wanderer, set out to explore the creeks and corners of the world. But behind the glimmer of those golden eyes hides a curiosity - a yearning of sorts - to uncover a mystery, one that is very dear to her. Although her heart might've changed as the years wore on, her purpose has not.  
Each lesson learned, each story formed, is to be honoured through song and melody.

## Description
Hidden underneath her darkened cloak is a flourish of vibrant colours. Her teal linen shirt is adorned with knick-knacks acquired from her travels across [[Wildemount]], ranging from small baubles, tokens of luck and wooden figurines to tiny chimes that surround her with the occasional melody of the wind even when she's not making music.
Her silver-white hair is braided to the side, caressing a light-green scarf that rests on the shoulders. The unusual pallor of her hair contrasts the warmth of her darker skin, with the golden hue of her eyes being the glowing crucible.

Gold, silver and bronze. Astryn is a memorable person. Although appearing as a young-adult, she is a well filled with wisdom, questions, and analogies. Regardless of whether she peaks the truth, her vast perspective is to be admired.
## Background
[[Aeon]] gave life to Astryn, as well as blessing her with her three spirit titles - The Philosopher, The Artist, (placeholder).


## Relations
Astryn has closely befriended her black mare [[Maple]], who is one of the few who she fully trusts. 

1400 years ago, during [[The Age of Arcanum]], Astryn met the witch [[Malifera]].

Astryn was given life by [[Aeon]], creator of spirits. Together with her siblings [[Mynark]] and [[Valnyr]], she was released from the branches of the cosmic tree and send towards the [[Prime Material]].

## Roleplay
***Voice***
- Soft and young, no particular accent.

***Manners***
- Curious and very mysterious. Is not inclined to share her intentions, especially since she is unsure about her own doings in the first place.
- She is *not* cautious at all, often finding herself in unwanted peril at the hands of her own choices.
