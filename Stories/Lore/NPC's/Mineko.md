>_A sweet little pathfinder, eager to follower the footsteps of her mother._

Mineko is a young [[Pathfinders|Pathfinder]] who finds herself often strolling through the [[Aurum Fields]] to guide [[Lantern Archons]], as [[Pathfinders]] do. Truth be told, she years for more. Her heart desires to climb the mountain of [[Mount Celestia|Celestia]] and chase the promise of seeing her mother once more.
Her father, [[Toru]], desperately tries to give Mineko the home she deserves. But every now and then, she will look up and wonder what is out there.

## Description
Mineko is an 14-year old [[Half-Elves|half-elven]] child. She looks more mature than she really is.

***Features***
- Large child-like brown eyes.
- Curious look on her face.
- Brown and short messy hair that covers the ears.
- Single braid sprouts form the messy hair and dangles on her right side.
- Freckles adorn her cheeks.
- Smudge of mud sits on her small nose.

***Clothing***
- Burgundy kasaya (old traditional robe).
- Patches of leatherwork armour cover her shoulders and wrists.
- Rope tightens the kasaya around the waist, making a girdle.
- Sheathed katana hangs from the belt.
- Wide dirt-coloured trousers that are tucked in high leather boots.
## Background
Mineko was adopted at a young age. She was found in the [[Aurum Fields]] when she was just a baby, and to this day her parents are unsure how she got there and to whom she belonged. Nevertheless, up until the age of 13 years old she was born and raised in the small village of [[Glynneath]]. She was eager to learn the ways of her mother [[Wind]], and soon became a [[Pathfinders|Pathfinder]] apprentice. Roaming the wilds, guiding [[Lantern Archons]] and scouting malicious creatures thrilled her.
But not but a year ago her mother [[Wind]] disappeared, leaving [[Toru]] and Mineko alone in their homestead in [[Glynneath]]. [[Toru]] rarely speaks of her, and when Mineko asks about where she has went, [[Toru]] avoids the questions and tells her to stop 'chasing ghosts'.
Mineko grieves in her own way, but as opposed to [[Toru]] who is cultivating a live without [[Wind]], Mineko is determined to one day find her, wherever she resides.
The child has heard the stories about pilgrims and [[Archons]], and she believes her mother must've ascended to [[Mercuria]] (and perhaps beyond). With her [[Pathfinders|Pathfinder]] skills, she often explores the outer edges of [[Lunia]] is an attempt to find a path up to mountain, to no avail. Moreover, [[Toru]] is extremely cautious with Mineko, afraid that he will lose her too one day.

During the last year, Mineko has primarily been honing more [[Pathfinders|Pathfinder]] skills, as she believes these are required to ascend the mountain. Her everyday life is made out of hunting foul creatures in the [[Aurum Fields]], guiding [[Lantern Archons]] towards [[Glynneath]] and helping [[Toru]] whenever he requires her to do so.
## Relations
She is the adopted daughter of [[Wind]] and [[Toru]].
## Goals
On the surface level, she is focused on improving her [[Pathfinders|Pathfinder]] skills. The thrill of exploring the wilds and guiding [[Archons]] fills her with joy. That said, the true reason for improving her skills is tight to her urge to climb the mountain and find her mother [[Wind]].
## Roleplay
***Voice***
- Raspy wavy voice.
- Pauses, gasps and rambling.

***Manners***
- High self-esteem.
- Confident.
- Extremely curious.
- Not cautious at all.
