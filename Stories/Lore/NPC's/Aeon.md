Time is the eldest spirit of all, an omnipotent servant of the [[Primordials]] even before the arrival of the [[Founders|gods]] and their meddling with the [[World Soul]].

## Description
Time is a titan-sized cosmic tree. Its roots carve deep and wide through the barren landscape of the [[Plenty-titled Wastes]], often comparable to the size of mountains.

The creature is so vast, that its trunk never seems to get closer. Instead, it forms a pillar of shadow against the night-sky above the horizon. Its branches weave themselves in-between the stars.
