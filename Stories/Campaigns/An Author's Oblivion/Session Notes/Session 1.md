## Scenes & Locations
### Crossroads inn

>[!quote]
>This story begins like any other... through the eyes of a raven . A creature that is a living metaphor for fate in the world of Exandria. Because of this, it is attracted to places and moments that are fateful.
>
>But up here, above the clouds that coat the land in mystery, there is nothing to be found but the ravaging winds that have claimed this realm, and the omnipresent serenity of nothingness. Though fate lingers here, it is but a child without trinkets and knick-knacks to play with - empty handed.
>
>The raven knows this. It knows that to get to know Exandria, one needs to see it. Hence, it chooses to put its faith entirely into fate - plunging downward in a free fall towards the fast approaching clouds that lay below.
>
>Ebon feathers battling against the rushing air,  it dives through the clouds until eventually beneath it - is revealed... the land of Wildemount.

Describe the land of [[Wildemount]]:
- The snow covered mountains of the [[Ashkeeper Peaks]] bisect the land in two.
- To the east, lie the desert plains of [[Xhorhas]]. A dry and barren wasteland scarred by [[The Calamity]], an ancient war between gods.
- Here, lingering abominations and spawns of the  [[Betrayer Gods]] wander the world still - unknowing what to do with their masters now banished.
- With evil residing in the east, the raven turns its eye to the west. Towards the [[Dwendalian Empire]], a land safeguarded by the surrounding [[Dunrock Mountains]] and numerous military outposts that protect the borders.
- At the promise of safety and prosperity, the people here live under the oppressing rule of [[King Bertrand Dwendal]], also known as [[Dwendalian Empire|The Crown]].
- Flying across the country we get to see universities of arcane study, archives containing the most ancient of records, large temples devoted to the [[Prime Deities]] and garrisons holding legions of [[Righteous Brand]] soldiers.

>[!quote]
>Though grandiose and mighty, the raven finds these places far from fateful. More often than not, the most interesting of stories are born in the hidden creeks and corners of the world. A gem yet to be found. A treasure yet to be mapped.
>
>And hence, the raven drifts down towards the [[Crispvale Thicket]], a small forest near the foot of a mountain. Snow gently caresses the tundra landscape of the north, escaping the roaring thunder that bellows from the heavens. The occasional flash of lightning illuminates the otherwise darkened evening, revealing numerous clustered pine trees, huddling together to withstand the cold.
>
>Under their canopy, we get to see glimpses of pebble-covered roads - long worn out -  that meander their way through the wilderness. Unguided, they provide a means of a journey towards a destination of once choosing.
>
>Where these roads meet, we see a solemn building - a tavern of the like. Made from oak wood and hardened stone, this haphazard cluster of rooms upon rooms proudly defies the harsh environment. The flickering light of a hearth can be seen through the many frost-covered windows that dot the walls. The raven hears laughter, smells food, and feels the warmth that radiates from both this place and the people that reside here.
>
>The raven eventually perches on the roof of this solemn building, watching as an individual approaches the outskirts of the tavern.
>
>From up here, it gets to see the fate of our heroes - and perhaps of something greater - begin to unfold.

### Meeting the Bartender
[[Archibald]] is sweating profusely and is acting nervous around others. He tries his best not to give his fear away, but the perceptive eye might notice his discomfort.

Signs of discomfort:
- Staring towards the door most of the time.
- Only partly listening.
- Sweating profusely.
- Tapping on the counter.

[[Baern]], [[Richard|Richard]] and [[Arev]] will be sitting at the bar as [[Zael]] enters, meaning [[Archibald]] will be in conversation with them. [[Archibald]] will seem zoned out, only partly listening to what the party has to say.

Conversation topics:
- Today's strange weather of both snow and rain. Thunder roars through the skies above.
- Ask about the party's adventures, and where they are heading to.

---

[[Archibald]]'s daughter is held captive in his own living quarters up in the tower-side of the tavern. He worries for her greatly, and will take risk in trying to get help.

Out of nowhere, [[Archibald]] will provide a run-down of today's menu, as well as offering the key to room n.9, which is directly in front of his own rooms (which holds his daughter).

Secret message using the food menu:
- Hellion's Cinder (spicy liquor)
- Evening Sip (sweet cocktail)
- Low Monsoon (red wine from [[Kamordah]])
- Pint (beer)
- Monad (burrito)
- Elderberry Pie (desert)

[[Archibald]] cannot express their concern or what exactly is the problem, since he's being watched by the [[Spirit Hunters]]. He will simply mutter "_Read lips_" before continuing with his work. He will instruct the party to keep their backs towards the room, lest their words will also be read.

### Encounter with the [[Spirit Hunters]]
[[Miriel|Spirit Huntress Miriel]] is planning to capture a spirit at [[Crossroads Inn]]. Criminals from the [[Trebain Family]] of [[Shadycreek Run]] have taken [[Archibald]]'s daughter hostage in order to get  full access to the tavern, including the ruined remains of the temple upon which the tavern was built.

[[Miriel]] wishes to lure [[Astryn|The Philosopher]] to the stone basement of the inn, from which she will take their heart.

[[Miriel]] uses a glass bottle filled with white butterflies (known as [[Bottled Pariah]]) to detect the presence of a [[Spirits|spirit]]. The butterflies fly in chaotic patterns, suggesting that indeed a [[Spirits|spirit]] is nigh.

[[Leoric Lynn|Sage Leoric]] will be drawn towards the basement, as [[Miriel]] suspects he is [[Astryn|The Philosopher]]. Her scouts will either lure him via the promise of knowledge, or a simple charm spell.

---
#### Foreboding signs
Signs of their secret meeting and mission can be found within the tavern, primarily in the form of [[Thieves Cant]] symbols. These intricate markings are unseen by most, except for the trained (criminal) eye. It has 3 components:
- An aging mark at the top-right corner. A skilled practitioner knows how to carve the symbol precisely, to the point where rubbing your finger against it after 7+ days will break a rigid corner. This is necessary, for these symbols often indicate a time and place (with a timespan of 7 days.
- A time indicator, numbering the day of the week, as well as the hour of the day.
- The base symbols are simple and compact, hence one symbol can have multiple meanings and they heavily rely on the context of other symbols found in a sequence.

A few of these symbols can be found:
- 7th day, 18th hour: _Clueless, Futile, Missing_
- 7th day, 20th hour: _Read, Target, Observe_
- 7th day, 21st hour: _Gather, Ruin, Basement_

---
#### Spilling secrets and intentions
Listening in or joining the conversation that is held in the ruined basement might reveal the following information:
- The thieves are just hirelings who have worked for [[Miriel]] before. They don't know for sure what her intentions are, but she pays well.
- [[Miriel]] is looking for a spirit by the title of [[Astryn|The Philosopher]].
- She gathered that the [[Soulgate]] construction under the [[Crossroads Inn]] would interest the spirit, hence it made for quite the easy ambush.
- [[Miriel]] will do by either obtaining the name of the spirit, or the heart. Since [[Leoric Lynn|Leoric]] doesn't know what she is talking about, she'll have to do with the heart.

### Arrival of [[Lorn]]
As Lorn spawns in the [[Prime Material]], the butterflies in the [[Bottled Pariah]] will turn to black. [[Miriel]]'s face will grow pale, as she knows what his entails: the arrival of [[Mynark]].

>[!quote]
>We need to get out, NOW! Pariah's eye is upon us.

She will drop the bottle and attempt to flee.

The ashes body of [[Lorn]] will walk through the portal before crumbling onto the ground. From his hand, the [[Oblivion Stone]] will drop.
### Arrival of [[Mynark]]
With [[Mynark]]'s arrival, the possibly dead [[Leoric Lynn|Leoric]] might turn undead and join the [[Savalir Rot]].
