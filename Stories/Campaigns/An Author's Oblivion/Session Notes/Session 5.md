## Ideas
[[Wind]] has climbed the mountain. She will be important later on in the campaign, as the party will eventually have to climb the mountain (during higher levels).

[[Mineko]] wishes to also ascend, to follow the footsteps of her mother.

[[Toru]] doesn't allow [[Mineko]] to ascend, for he knows that almost all fail the trial of [[Solania]] and get eternally trapped in [[Uroboros]].

---

[[Nebeus]] trails the party from the get-go, his golden image visible in the edges of our party's periphery.

## Character Review
#### [[Arev]]
***Background***
Has recently received another (vivid) vision of his mission within the [[Savalir Wood]], where the names [[Astryn]], [[Valnyr]] and [[Mynark]] were revealed. [[Mynark|The Pariah]] made their first appearance within the vision, and shortly after invaded [[Malifera]]'s abode.

***Motivation***
Escape [[Mynark|The Pariah]] and find more information about the vision of his eye.

---
#### [[Stories/Campaigns/An Author's Oblivion/Player Characters/Baern|Baern]]
***Background***
Has come to the conclusion that he is bound to [[Thanatos|The Pilgrim under the Stars]] by name and pain. Was ought to ask how to rid the world of a name, [[Malifera]] answered that she knew of ways - albeit ancient ones.

***Motivation***
Figure out what [[Thanatos|The Pilgrim]] actually wants. Why get rid of a name?

---
#### [[eve]]
***Background***
Led the party to [[Malifera]]'s abode following [[Astryn]]'s instructions. Was not inclined to travel to [[Mount Celestia]] in order to escape [[Mynark|The Pariah]], but accepted the party's decision either way.

***Motivation***
Find a way out of [[Mount Celestia|Celestia]]. Overcome her fear of actually taking part in an adventure.

---
#### [[Richard|Richard Morningwood]]
***Background***
Won a game of chess against [[Malifera]], and was promised an item from her personal vault.

***Motivation***
Somehow find a way to acquire [[Malifera]]'s treasure.

---
#### [[Skye]]
***Background***
Nothing to special.

***Motivation***
Self-improvement in [[Mount Celestia]].

---
#### [[Zael]]
***Background***
Damaged some stuff in [[Malifera]]'s abode. Also saw another set of words being scribed into the wall by the [[Oblivion Stone]].

***Motivation***
Self-improvement in [[Mount Celestia]]. Also find out more about the [[Oblivion Stone]].

## Scenes & Locations
### [[Aurum Fields]]

>[!info]
>Music:
>- Aurum Fields
>- [Windy Countryside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfiDTOst3L4)

>_Landing in the [[Aurum Fields]]:_
>Just now you were surrounded by the wooden walls of [[Malifera]]'s abode. Right as the plane shift spell was invoked - [[Mynark|The Pariah]] still standing in the doorway - the walls eventually closed in on you, before dissipating completely.
>
>For but a moment you found yourself drifting through the Astral sea, the connective tissue holding all the realms together. Both the heavens, and the hells. Chaos and order.
>
>But the Astral is not meant for mere mortals, and soon you found yourselves _somewhere else_ entirely...
>
>---
>
>As eyes adjust to the light of day, your feet gracefully land in the dirt. A gentle wind blows that creates mesmerising patterns in the enormous all-surrounding fields of mellow coloured grass. The blades dance back and forth and stretch to the horizons of this realm. The occasional rock outcropping and cherry blossom tree dot the landscape, giving it character. 
>
>Golden leaves flutter just above ground, some get caught within your hair as a sudden gust rushes past. The gust brings with it a sweet smell of morning dew enriched with a tangy scent of pinewood.
>
>Although the grass fields seem endless, there is one clear destination ahead. Reaching for the golden and silver skies above, you see the base of a titan-sized mountain - so large, even the gods themselves must've climbed their way upward towards the heavens.
>It is only now that you realise there is not sun to be found in this realm. Instead, through the clouds and mist cloaking the skies, you see the silhouette - the promise - of a radiating mountain top.
>
>Thus here you stand, having narrowly escaped some dangerous three-titled entity. You take a breath, but also a breather from all the peril and tribulations that have happened over the last night. The attack on the [[Crossroads Inn]], the chase through the [[Crispvale Thicket]] and the dealings with [[Malifera]] back in the world of Exandria.
>
>In the presence of heavenly forces, it hits you - just how quickly your lives have changed... for better or worse.
>
>---
>
>[[Arev]], never before has a vision been granted to you whilst awake. Moreover, it was vivid - as if you were there in the moment. 
>As your friends settle themselves shortly after the teleportation spell, you can't stop yourself from thinking about what you saw. Three names, engraved in a stone statue of a tree. A door barely held shut, and [[Mynark|The Pariah]] closing in on you whilst swarms of butterflies swept by.
>
>[[Baern]], [[Thanatos|The Pilgrim]] is alive - he is bound to you by death and name. You have so many questions swirling through your mind. How is he alive? Why does he need you? What does he want?
>According to him, your newfound friends would be safe, as long as you abided his commands. You've done so for now, but is this truly a path your willing to take? Time will tell.
>
>[[eve]], whilst some of your friends choose to reminisce, you can't help but feel a surge of panic flow through you - not because of the past, but due to where you stand... _here_ and _now_.
>[[Mount Celestia]], a realm you've heard so many stories about. Heck, you have told plentiful stories about this place as well. But to actually be here, it almost frightens you. It begs the question: is the struggle of adventure worth the promise of a story to tell?
>
>[[Richard]], a smile creeps up on your face, for the otherworldly invigorates you. Lands that few dare to traverse is where _you_ thrive. To venture into the unknown and claim that which has yet to be claimed - this is what you live for.
>But it is not the reason for the sudden joy that stirs within. No, for that is fuelled by the presence of daylight. You've come to realise that [[Malifera]] has a promise to fulfil.
>
>[[Skye]], you take in the beauty of your surroundings. Although the endless golden fields are vastly different from the lush jungles of your [[Elves|elven]] homeland, you still find yourself holding your breath in awe.
>Some would think the ranger part of you - the outlander - causes you to admire nature in the way you do, but there is far more to it than meets the eye.
>Your fingers caress the engraved name of Elysia on your longbow. A thought enters the mind: "_If only she could be here to see this._"
>
>And finally, [[Zael]]. From questioning to whether divinity even exists, to finding yourself being stranded in one of their heavens. The last 24-hours have certainly showed you facets of this world you presumed to be absurd. Moreover, you have that tantalizing feeling of being at the crux of something greater.
>Perpetual night, undead rising from the afterlife, spirits chasing you, and that strange figure walking through the portal and dying in front of your eyes. Is this beyond you?
>Your hand reaches for the [[Oblivion Stone]], still hidden within bag. It thrums and feels warmer to the touch, as it has aforetime.
>At your feet, engraved within the dirt and only visible to your eyes, are the words: "_Bring me home._"



The party finds themselves amongst the high-grass of the [[Aurum Fields]]. The grass reaches their knees, hence it is easy to overlook the vegetation and inspect the distant surroundings.
As soon as the party teleports, [[Malifera]] will collapse to her knees as her strength falters. At the same time, [[Nebeus]]' image will apparate behind the party and form a distance. Lastly, the moving trail of a [[Lantern Archons|Lantern Archon]] will meander through the grass, approaching them.
#### [[Malifera]]'s sickness
Although [[Malifera]] is a lawful creature, she is profoundly evil in her very nature. Due to this, the goodness of the realm is weighing her down.

- [ ] Time seems so infinite when you're young. A month is an age, a year is a lifetime.
#### Meeting [[Toru]]
[[Mineko]] tells the party that her dead knows of a way to get back to the [[Prime Material]]. But she will only introduce them to him if the party also helps her ascend the mountain. She wishes to reach [[Mercuria]] and beyond.

Plea from [[Toru]]:

>[!quote]
>My lovely child [[Mineko]] has the heart of a hero, it is filled to the brim with courage and curiosity. I adore it, for her mother was exactly the same. [[Wind]] was her name. It suited her, the wind always seemed to listen to her in ways I was unable to understand. [[Wind]] was a great pathfinder, one of the best. I'm thankful that [[Mineko]] has had such a great teacher.
>
>I still remember her returning to our home each day. And each day she was strikingly beautiful, carrying a basket of [[Lantern Archons]] under her arm, her pathfinder gear dirty from all the playful chasing in the [[Aurum Fields]].
>She would often stand still in the doorway. The wind would blow through her sky-blue hair, dancing with the streaks of viridian and purple that rounded her ears. In those moments of stillness, she would close her eyes, clutch her hands together and let the light of Celestia fall upon her skin. She would just... _feel_ the moment. As if it would be her last.
>
>Until one day it was... her last moment. _Our_ last moment. 
>
>She never returned. I prayed to the gods of this realm to tell me where she was, but none answered. We didn't see her ever since.
>
>- _Mineko playfully skips outside, seen through the windows of the homestead_
>
>It's been hard on Mineko, to live a life without [[Wind]]. She believes that her mother ascended the mountain, and she desperately wishes to follow her footsteps in an attempt to find her. 
>But I cannot let her. The journey of a pilgrim is not meant for a child. Most if not all pilgrims fail to even reach the 5th heaven of [[Mount Celestia|Celestia]], let alone make it to the radiating top of the 7th heaven  [[Chronias]].
>
>I do not wish my child to face such a cruel fate, even with the promise of seeing [[Wind]] once more. There's no merit to be found in chasing ghosts.
>
>So we choose to stay, to reminisce and cherish the moments we've had. To anchor ourselves to the place where it all began, and where it will end. Our home.
>
>Even without [[Wind]], this home is my everything. If it were to burn to the ground, I will burn down with it...
