## Scenes & Locations
### Autumn flashback
[[Astryn]] - also known as the Philosopher - is making their way to the [[Crossroads Inn]], traversing the well-known path of the [[Glory Run Road]].

On this beautiful autumn day, she will meet [[Skye]], a lonesome and good-hearted ranger from the [[Elves|elven]] lands. She will inquire what he is on about, his journey and purpose. The conversation might end with [[Astryn]] asking for some rations for her mare [[Maple]] (connecting this scene with the ominous encounter with [[Husk]]).
