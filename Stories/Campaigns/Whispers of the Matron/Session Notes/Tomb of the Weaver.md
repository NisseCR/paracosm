## Scenes & Locations
### Sewers of [[Nogvurot]]
With the release of [[The Weaver]], the tomb under the tower of [[Shadar]] sustained so much force damage, the entire structure sank to the ground. Due to this, the underground tunnels of [[Nogvurot]] sit at an angle. Fresh water flows through the sewers in the opposite direction, towards the enormous earth fissures that separate the sewers from [[Shadar]].
