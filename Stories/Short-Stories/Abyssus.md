### Awaken on [[The Valiant]]

>[!quote]
>This tale, begins with a dream - or rather a nightmare. As of right now, the only sound that fills your surroundings is that of your own heartbeat. A rhythm's whose pacing quickens - your heart knows something's amiss.
>You do _not_ hear the sound of your breath, for this place you find yourselves in - this vivid phantom realm of the mind - it sits beneath the waves. Frigid water engulfs you, your body undulating with the ebb and flow of the ocean. You're sinking, slowly.
>Only but a glimpse of light reaches this far down, creating an abyssal backdrop of indigo and black.
