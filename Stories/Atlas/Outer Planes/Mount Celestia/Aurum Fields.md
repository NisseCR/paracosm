These fields surround the base of [[Mount Celestia]] on the plane of [[Lunia]]. It is an endless expanse of golden grass fields that stretches towards the horizon, meeting the veil that bisects [[Bytopia]] and [[Arcadia]] from the realm of [[Mount Celestia|Celestia]].
## Lantern checkpoint
[[Lantern Archons]], souls from the prime, make their way through the Aurum Fields before beginning their journey towards [[Chronias]]. They leave behind trails of golden and ethereal light in their wake, creating bending patterns within the grass.

Those who live a mortal life here, and are hence not an [[Archons|Archon]], choose to still find their purpose within the realm by guiding the [[Lantern Archons]] towards the many paths that lead to [[Mercuria]]. These people call themselves [[Pathfinders]].
