![[Snow View.jpg]]

Celestia is the pinnacle realm of lawful goodness in the [[Great Wheel Cosmology]]. The realm bares a mountain that stretches across the horizon and reaches for the heavens above - its peak always obfuscated by the clouds above, its base surrounded by endless waters of the [[Silver Sea]]. The mountain is seemingly endless, yet Celestia's denizens - called [[Archons]] - still attempt to ascend it in order to self-improve.

Though many attempt to climb the mountain, only but a few even make it to the 4th layer of the mountain.

The realm is dedicated to goodness shaped by law and justice tempered with mercy. Honour, law, justice are ideologies most prevalent here.

## Layers
Although Mount Celestia is often portraited as one enormous mountain, in reality it is bisected by different realms / layers. The tip of the mountain always seems to be obfuscated by a thick layer of clouds, barring anyone from directly venturing towards the next layer without following a path of honour, law, valour or the like.

These paths connect the Celestial realms with one another, with a gate usually marking the veil between these layers. A [[Warden Archons|Warden Archon]] guards these doorways, making sure the law is abided.
Temples, camps and even entire settlements can be found along these paths.

In a way, each layer is a trial, a test of sorts, to ascertain whether a pilgrim is worthy of ascending the mountain.

Mount Celestia has seven layers (or heavens):
1. [[Lunia]]
2. [[Mercuria]]
3. [[Venya]]
4. [[Solania]]
5. [[Mertion]]
6. [[Jovar]]
7. [[Chronias]]
## Divinity
[[Bahamut]]'s palace floats in-between the cloud borders of Mount Celestia. The palace's silhouette can sometimes be seen by the denizens of [[Lunia]], but reaching it is far more challenging.

[[Moradin]] and his [[Forge of Creation]] can be found within the fourth heaven of [[Solania]], hidden deep within the mountain itself.

Lastly, [[Jazirian]] resides in [[Uroboros]] on the 4th layer of [[Solania]] as well, where he guards over the pilgrims who've failed to ascend the mountain.

## Travelling across planes
Those who teleport to Celestia with [[Arcane Magic]] will find themselves in the realm of [[Lunia]] at first. Throughout history, there have been no records of mages being able to magically teleport towards higher layers, as is forbidden by the [[Tome Archons]] that rule over each realm. By the law of the realm, one can only climb the mountain by foot.

Traversing the waters of the [[Silver Sea]] in [[Lunia]] may sometimes present planar gateways towards the neighbouring realms of [[Bytopia]] and [[Arcadia]], though these landmarks are hard to spot.
