>Mount Celestia is inspired by eastern culture.

Celestia is the pinnacle realm of absolute lawful goodness in the [[Great Wheel Cosmology]] and the land of promise & purpose. The realm bares a mountain that stretches across the horizon and reaches for the heavens above - its peak always obfuscated by the clouds above, its base surrounded by endless grass fields of the [[Aurum Fields]]. The mountain is seemingly endless, yet Celestia's denizens - called [[Archons]] - still attempt to ascend it in order to self-improve. Other ancestries also call this plane home, though [[Archons]] do represent the goal of many and what many are striving for.

Though many attempt to climb the mountain, only but a few even make it to the 4th layer of the mountain.

The realm is dedicated to goodness shaped by law and justice tempered with mercy. Honour, law, justice are ideologies most prevalent here.

## Layers
Although Mount Celestia is often portraited as one enormous mountain, in reality it is bisected by different realms / layers. The tip of the mountain always seems to be obfuscated by a thick layer of clouds, barring anyone from directly venturing towards the next layer without following a path of honour, law, valour or the like.

These paths connect the Celestial realms with one another, with a gate usually marking the veil between these layers. A [[Warden Archons|Warden Archon]] guards these doorways, making sure the law is abided.
Temples, camps and even entire settlements can be found along these paths.

In a way, each layer is a trial, a test of sorts, to ascertain whether a pilgrim is worthy of ascending the mountain.

Mount Celestia has seven layers (or heavens):
1. [[Lunia]]
2. [[Mercuria]]
3. [[Venya]]
4. [[Solania]]
5. [[Mertion]]
6. [[Jovar]]
7. [[Chronias]]

Much is known about the lower layers of [[Mount Celestia|Celestia]], whilst the higher layers are cloaked in mystery. Especially the plane of [[Chronias]] is completely unknown to the pilgrims and [[Archons]] of the realm, since only the pure of heart are able to enter that layer of the mountain - and they never return from their journey.
## Divinity
[[Bahamut]]'s palace floats in-between the cloud borders of Mount Celestia. The palace's silhouette can sometimes be seen by the denizens of [[Lunia]], but reaching it is far more challenging.

[[Moradin]] and his [[Forge of Creation]] can be found within the fourth heaven of [[Solania]], hidden deep within the mountain itself.

Lastly, [[Jazirian]] resides in [[Uroboros]] on the 4th layer of [[Solania]] as well, where he guards over the pilgrims who've failed to ascend the mountain.

## Travelling across planes
Paladins, pilgrims and clerics often find themselves beginning the journey up the mountain. Outsiders are either lawful good, or working towards becoming it.

Those who teleport to Celestia with [[Arcane Magic]] will find themselves in the realm of [[Lunia]] at first. Throughout history, there have been no records of mages being able to magically teleport towards higher layers, as is forbidden by the [[Tome Archons]] that rule over each realm. By the law of the realm, one can only climb the mountain by foot.

Traversing the [[Aurum Fields]] in [[Lunia]] may sometimes present planar gateways towards the neighbouring realms of [[Bytopia]] and [[Arcadia]], though these landmarks are hard to spot.
## Journey
As you climb the mountain, you must become more pure whilst pushing out chaos and evil, following a spiritual and physical journey. [[Archons]] start this journey in lantern form, seeking out the aspiration of becoming a [[Hound Archons|Hound Archon]]. Many more [[Archons|Archon]] forms exist, each of which is the next stage in the journey up the mountain.
In the end, all [[Archons]] whish to become one with the realm by reaching the [[Chronias]]. That said, this process often takes aeons to complete. Moreover, there are only a select few that even make it past the 4th layer of [[Solania]].

There are multiple paths that lead up the mountain, each confining a pilgrim to a specific purpose. Choosing a path bestows the pilgrim with a specific power, granted by a patron (usually an [[Archons|Archon]]), whilst requiring the pilgrim to devote their life to said purpose (e.g. taking a vigil, giving a token).

A pilgrim is bound to a path until the next layer of [[Mount Celestia]] is reached. Their path will be relinquished if they leave the realm.

Even when protected by fellow [[Lantern Archons]], there are many dangers that reside in the mountain. People die climbing their way up to [[Chronias]].

The variants are:
- Eightfold Path: patience, pacifism, courage, joy, discipline, generosity, kindness and teaching others.
- Path of Five Virtues: honesty, charity, hope, moderation and tolerance.
- Path of Valour: good deeds corroborated by others, you may not speak of them yourself.
- Path of Renunciation: constant charity for those who ask it, poverty, stripping of belongings except for set of clothes, mortification of the flesh (suffering). Beg for every single thing that you need.
