![[Endless Mountain.jpg]]

Celestia is the pinnacle realm of lawful goodness in the [[Great Wheel Cosmology]]. The realm bares a mountain that stretches across the horizon and reaches for the heavens above - its peak always obfuscated by the clouds above, its base surrounded by endless waters of the [[Silver Sea]]. The mountain is seemingly endless, yet Celestia's denizens - called [[Archons]] - still attempt to ascend it.
