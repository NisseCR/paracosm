![[Gruumsh E.png]]
Gruumsh commands hordes of barbaric marauders to destroy, pillage, and slaughter for the sheer joy of it. Orderless and without honour, the creeds of the evil hordemaster urge savage creatures to devour the world around them, giving in to the chaotic and selfish nature of the predator. A number of violent clans of humanoids and beasts across [[Xhorhas]] pay homage to Gruumsh, asking him to bless their hunts and gift them with spoils worth ruining.

Gruumsh rules the barren plains of [[Nishrek]] in the chaotic realm of [[Acheron]], where he stokes the fury of his twisted armies and prepares to wage a violent war across the planes.
## Depiction
Primitive clay representations in barbaric communities of his followers show the Ruiner as a hulking, bulbous behemoth of an [[Orcs|Orc]]. His missing eye has shifted, and the prominent eye is now centred in his face, like a nightmarish cyclops.
## Enemies
[[Corellon]] shot out Gruumsh's right eye during [[The Calamity]], and the god of slaughter longs for the day he can return the favour twofold. Those who serve the Ruiner are sometimes hypnotized by his hateful rage from across the [[Divine Gate]] and fall into a strange bloodlust, longing to slaughter [[Elves]] and those who worship magic at the altar of [[Corellon|The Arch Heart]].
## Commandments
- Ruin. Conquer. Kill.
- The weak exist to be crushed by the strong. Be the strong.
- There are no emotions but fury and joy. The rest are weakness.
