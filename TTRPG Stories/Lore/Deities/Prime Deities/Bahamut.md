![[Bahamut E.png]]
The pillar of justice, protection, nobility, and honour, Bahamut is a beacon to paladins of order and good, and is revered by most metallic dragons as the first of their kind. The crest of the Platinum Dragon adorns many halls of high leadership and justice, invoking his will in all matters of justice. To follow him is to look after those who cannot look after themselves.

When not wandering the [[Outer Planes]], Bahamut resides within his magnificent, glittering palace of gold, platinum, and mithril hidden among the winds of the Seven Heavens of [[Mount Celestia]].
## Depiction
The Platinum Dragon is often seen emblazoned on shields and armour, both functional and decorative, in the form of a brilliant dragon head in profile. Temples and works of art depict a massive, glittering dragon with vibrant platinum scales and seemingly endless wingspan.
## Holy Day
Bahamut's holy day is called [[Embertide]], and is celebrated on the fifth day of Duscar. This is a day of remembrance, solemnity, and respect for those who have fallen in the defence of others.
## Commandments
- Stand as a paragon of honour and justice.
- Smite evil wherever it is found, yet show compassion to those who have strayed from the path of righteousness.
- Defend the weak, bring freedom to the persecuted, and protect the ideals of justice and order.
