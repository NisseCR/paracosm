![[Rites of Ascension.jpg]]

Also known as the Ritual of Seeding, or the Matron's Ritual, this powerful magic enables a mortal to ascend to godhood. During [[The Age of Arcanum]], it was considered the pinnacle achievement of arcane arts and hence formed an aspiration to many an archmage of that time.

Throughout the history of Exandria, the Rites of Ascension have only been invoked once by a women whose name has been sundered away from both history and memory alike. She was the first mortal (and the last thereof) to challenge the [[God of Death]] at that time, taking their place in the pantheon of deities as [[Raven Queen]].

The other gods feared for their own existence and sought to seal away the knowledge of these rites to prevent further mortal ascensions to transpire. This mission was spearheaded by [[Ioun]].

Though the gods believed the reevoking of these rites to be impossible, mages of past and present - filled with hubris and a desire for power - have made it their life's work to invoke the Ritual of Seeding once more, often ending in their own demise. Even centuries after the Matron's ascension, Ioun's efforts hold steadfast.
