I want to preface this with the fact that this is _not_ campaign specific. The things I'm about to mention are prevalent in all of my campaigns, even those that have been going on for years now. This message is meant for all of my players, and is not tailored to this group in particular.
Also, I'm not quitting D&D nor this campaign - so no need to worry about that whilst reading this update.

---

As a DM, I'm finding myself to be in a weird spot right now. Most of the time I'm deeply satisfied with the story and the player's enthusiasm and their reactions to a session, it truly invigorates me. That said, there are rare moments where sessions make me feel incredibly exhausted and mentally drained afterwards, all the while I'm worrying whether my players had a great time or not. These feelings come up even when - as a whole - people clearly had fun at the table and the session was a success.
During the last weekend I had to cancel a session due to this exhaustion, which opted me to tackle the problem as this was the first time it had such a significant impact on my capability/will to prepare and run D&D.

I've already reached out to some of my players, with some extensive back-and-forth conversations. Once again, thank you kindly for your feedback, it gave me some much needed insight. Through their feedback, I've been trying to pinpoint what causes this (infrequent) stress and exhaustion. Hence I've come up with this write-up in order to inform the rest of you, and hopefully change things up in order to solve this issue.

In short, it seems that I'm experiencing form of DM burnout (this is quite a common thing amongst DM's). In particular, it is the moments in-between sessions where I sometimes feel burned out, rather than during the sessions themselves. It all boils down to the following problems:
- ***Inspiration & ideas.*** It takes more and more effort to come up with new ideas. Drawing inspiration from art, media, my own life experience or ideas manifested throughout the years have proven to be an excellent source of inspiration for me. That said, as of late that pool of ideas has begun to dwindle. This is not a problem per se, but it does mean that creating a new story arc, plot, NPC or the like takes _a lot_ more time - they are completely new ideas rather than being based on existing ones that have lingered within the mind for some time.
- ***Session preparation.*** Some parts of session preparation begin to feel like a chore. I still enjoy major parts of session prep (e.g. creating descriptions, tying in backstories, envisioning scenes), but I have come to the conclusion that some aspects of it feel like a *must* rather than something I do for my own enjoyment.
- ***Fear of failing my players.*** This has been an underlying problem for a while now, and also heavily ties into the amount of effort I put into D&D as a whole. It seems my enjoyment of the game is very reliant on the _perceived_ enjoyment of my players - it is as if my enjoyment can only be justified if I observe clear signs of my players enjoying D&D at the same time. This is a problem, since the perception through which I'm trying to observe these signs is also skewed, making it harder to relieve myself of this stress. Moreover, the smallest of interactions can cause a great sense of insecurity and/or dread even when - as previously mentioned - people are clearly having a great time. I should mention though, the kind words from my players throughout the last few days have lessened this feeling of dread.
- ***Living up to expectations.*** It's becoming harder and harder for me as a DM to live up to (my own) high expectations of what a game of D&D _should be_. As of right now, a story/session - to me - requires certain set of aspects in order to be "fully fleshed out" and feel complete. It is becoming more difficult to fulfil this self-imposed list of constraints.

It took quite some time to figure out what caused this sense of burnout, but I do believe the above summarises it quite well. I'd also like to point out once more that these feelings of anxiety are infrequent, but they do exist.

Knowing this, I'd like to share my own opinion on possible solutions in order to combat this issue. This might mean changing the way in which I prepare and run sessions, but might also entail changes in my player's playstyle and their attitude towards the game.
Before going through this list of suggestions though, I would like to share some extra context - namely the amount of effort that goes into a game of D&D.
## DM workload
The amount of energy, time and effort that goes into a homebrew game is often underestimated by players, especially by those who have never run a game before. This is not me being a pretentious DM, it is simply my experience with players who have tried DM'ing and what I commonly come across on the internet.

To illustrate, in _An Author's Oblivion_ we're only 5 sessions into the campaign and I already have **20 pages** full of concise notes and scribbles of ideas when inspiration strikes - ranging from names, quotes, plot twists, scenes, endings, locations, world-building, relations, character stories to the most random ideas. As for my other campaigns - namely *Whispers of the Matron* and _Tales of the Divine Conundrum_ - I cannot even begin to fathom how much ideas I've messaged myself in discord, written in my notebook or are still floating around in my head. It is one of the major reasons why I've opted to just reuse a story for my 4th campaign, because I simply do not have the time to come up with yet another new homebrew campaign.
Another example are custom battlemaps. These take a good chunk of time to make. The simple ones take 1+ hours to make, whilst the detailed big-moment-ooh-yikes-were-gonna-die battlemaps sometimes take **5+ hours** to make. That is 5 hours of prep without even having considered balancing monster statblocks, choosing monster abilities, including player skillsets into combat and trying to add narrative-driven elements to the battle.
Lastly, art and descriptions also play a big part in my sessions. I often find myself (when dedicated and energised) fully writing out scenes, dialogue or location descriptions - carefully choosing my words whilst trying to make my prose as immersive as can be. This takes at least 1 hour to prepare as well, but usually sits around the 2-3 hour mark.
Part of a DM's workload goes into the preparation of things, but that does not mean that running a game goes by effortlessly. On the contrary, running the game at the (virtual) table requires constant attention. I'm continuously trying to read the room: including players who might feel excluded, giving players the spotlight, adapting to player input whilst rewiring ideas in my brain for what's to come, trying to assess the pacing of the story and adjusting it if need be, improvising a good amount for all the questions and interactions that one simply can't prepare for, and much much more.

It is important to note that all of the above is why I _like_ D&D (or any TTRPG of that matter). I live for creating immersive descriptions, compelling characters, high-stake encounters and memorable moments - it is the reason why I tell stories - but it is good to keep in mind it that these things do require a lot of time and energy investment.
## Improvements
Talking with people, researching the matter and writing it all down has resulted in me coming up with a few promising suggestions and changes that might relieve me of these sporadic moments of anxiety, stress and/or exhaustion. Whether these will work or not, who is to say - but better to try some of them than to ignore this entire issue.
Please do take the time to give it a thorough read, as I greatly value all of your opinions on the matter. Some of the concepts described below might not apply to you as a player, or to the group as a whole. Either way, it still gives good insight as to what I enjoy in D&D the most and concerns that currently occupy the mind.

Below I'll give a few concepts that rebalance both my expectations of the game, as well as yours as a player.

***Collaborative storytelling and pacing.*** What do I mean by collaborative storytelling? Well, it is an outright wrong perception that the DM is solely responsible for the story that unfolds. I think most - if not all of you - already realise this. It is the interaction between the players and the DM that create a compelling tale. That said, the extent to which a player or group gives input to the story can vary, especially considering the smaller details within said story. To illustrate, here are two scenes to highlight the difference between the amount of collaborative storytelling a group can provide.
#### Scene 1 - Minimal player input

>[!quote]
>**DM**: You open the door and find yourselves in a crowded bakery. The sweet scent of pastries hit your nose, whilst the chatter of a dozen or so people brings the establishment to life. What do you do?
>
>**Player 1**: Is there a person behind the counter serving the pastries?
>
>**DM**: Yes, you see _Dara_ - who you've met before during the festival - currently talking to their clientele. They are swamped with work it seems.
>
>**Player 1 to group**: Should we ask them about the strange disappearances?
>
>**Player 2**: Yeah sure!
>
>**Player 3**: Though I think we shouldn't mention the cloaked assassins to them though, who knows they might be working with them.
>
>**Player 1**: Sure. I'll walk up to Dara and ask if they've heard anything about the disappearances as of late.
>
>**DM**: Dara looks up to you and says, "I've heard a story or two about the strange happenings of last night. Though I must say I'm unaware of what exactly transpired". They point to the people chatting in the bakery, "Rumours are thrown about left and right, but who is to say which of them are true?"
>
>**Player 1**: I say, "Okay... thank you for sharing. If you do hear anything interesting, make sure to contact us!"
>
>**DM**: Dara responds, "Will do."
>
>_Moment of silence as players contemplate on what to do._
>
>**DM**: People behind you get agitated as you hold up the line, if there's anything you want to say to Dara, you might want to do it now.
>
>**Player 2 to group**: Should we leave and ask the blacksmith?
>
>**Player 3**: Maybe? Before we go, I wanna make a perception check to see if any suspicious people are within the bakery.
>
>**DM**: Sure roll for perception.
>
>**Player 3**: I rolled a 21.
>
>**DM**: _Proceeds to give detailed descriptions of people present in the bakery, most of which is improvised._

#### Scene 2 - Maximum player input
>[!quote]
>**DM**: You open the door and find yourselves in a crowded bakery. The sweet scent of pastries hit your nose, whilst the chatter of a dozen or so people brings the establishment to life. What do you do?
>
>**Player 1**: Is there a person behind the counter serving the pastries?
>
>**DM**: Yes, you see _Dara_ - who you've met before during the festival - currently talking to their clientele. They are swamped with work it seems.
>
>**Player 2**: Ooh I can imagine there's a big line of people waiting to buy pastries. I'll try to join the line, but using my small form I'll skip a few people without getting noticed, at least I'll try to do that.
>
>**DM**: Awesome, roll a stealth check.
>
>**Player 2**: 24!
>
>**DM**: Using your nimble form, you manage to stealthily sneak by people and make it to the counter.
>
>**Player 3**: In the mean time, and assuming that **Player 2** will ask about the events of last night, I'll try to keep an eye on the people outside to make sure we're not being watched. So I'll approach one of the tables near the front of the establishment, perhaps passing by a dwarf whose beard is currently filled with crumbles of dough, and look through the window and towards the busy streets.
>
>**DM**: Yeah go for it. Make a perception check, with advantage since this is your skillset.
>
>**Player 3**: Ugh, I rolled a 5.
>
>**DM**: Okay I'll keep that in mind, but for now you're watching your surroundings. Good to know.
>
>**Player 3**: I think with that roll, I'll begin by keeping an eye on the street, but quickly turn to scribbling some Thieves Cant into the table. And I'll just zone out a bit.
>
>**Player 2**: Also my character is _not_ approaching Dara to ask about the assassins, I'm just here to buy my favourite pastry!
>
>**Player 1**: Ooh in that case I'll also join the line, without skipping ahead that is. Don't wanna cause any trouble.
>
>**DM**: Awesome! **Player 2** you quickly make it to the counter, your small form barely able to make eye-contact with Dara.
>
>**Player 2**: Before saying anything, my eyes will dart left and right - inspecting all the cookies and pastries Dara has made. Within seconds, I'll spot my favourite.
>_proceeds to give a detailed description of a cake, most of which is improvised_.

With these two scenes, I'm trying to illustrate the difference in the amount of narrative and proactive intentions a player can bring to the table. That is to say, how much a player is willing to add to the imagination that we all share as a group. 
More often than not, I find myself describing a scene and I'll ask my player what they wish to do. This is sometimes followed by a silence of contemplation, perhaps because players are figuring out the best approach, or perhaps they wish to convey their plan with the group first.
But also, it might be because there's no choice to be made, or there isn't as much to do. This often leads to the group saying _"Yeah we approach"_, which is the obvious thing to do. This will then lead into a chain of scenes where I, the DM, will again describe something new as you approach. I'll follow this by asking what the party intends to do, who again choose the obvious (e.g. descending the stairs), etc etc.

I feel like this succession of small narrative steps slows down the pacing, which is bad in my opinion. It begs the question why I continue doing this then? Well, I'm trying to create a space in which the player feels invited to add to the narrative. And when this rarely occurs, I'm starting to doubt myself and will take slow steps in order to not accidently skip out on a scene a player _did_ wish to act upon.

That is why **Scene 2** is so important to me. It shows players who are not afraid to take the narrative wheel and describe what happens. Their input is character oriented - "I do this, and I'll see what the rest of the group does." The idea of my players joining in on this collaborative way of storytelling gives me the following prospect:
- Knowing that they will add to the story when they feel like it, I am less inclined to describe every little step of the narrative. This increases the pacing of the session, bringing us closer to the scenes that have a great impact which - coincidentally - also are much easier to prepare as a DM. This alleviates the necessity for me to write out every little detail in order to facilitate a space in which players feel inclined to roleplay and/or take the narrative.
- By giving my players more artistic freedom (e.g. the dwarf with the beard full of crumbles, **Player 3** occupying themselves with writing Thieves Cant, or **Player 2** describing their favourite pastry), these scenes will be filled with imaginative titbits and hooks upon which I can act upon. If **Player 3** is keeping in eye out, then perhaps they'll eventually notice someone shady approaching the bakery. Did I ever plan there to be someone shady approaching the bakery? No. Do I feel confident just improvising this because **Player 3** allowed for this narrative play to happen? Totally!
- It shifts the storytelling from a out-of-character focused narrative to a more in-character version.

In short, the above creates a playstyle where the DM is less inclined to continuously present details and descriptions - instead, the players help to paint the scene as well, which in turn will inspire the DM again.

Is is important to note that **Scene 2** is called **Maximum player input**. To no extent do I expect my players to abide to this exact playstyle. I think it's quite rare to find players who are able to do such a thing. It's just a means of illustrating that D&D shouldn't feel like a one-way narrative from the DM's perspective.

***Committed roleplay.*** In truth, I could sit around a table with people and tell a story without rolling a single dice or using a single rule from a TTRPG system, just by using the theatre of the mind. It is the reason why I revel in moments of immaculate roleplay, I want my heart to be broken and healed. Of course, this drama-oriented playstyle isn't for everyone, and that's totally okay! We're all here to have fun after all, and that means finding a balance between preferred playstyles between the DM and their players, making compromises if need be.
That said, I think it's good for me to share what I love the most about D&D. So if you ever feel like there's an opportunity for in-character roleplay, either initiated by you the player or the DM, seize it! I will guarantee you that the group will be all for it. Moreover, it is those moments that I like to reminisce about, which in turn give me motivation to prepare the next session thereafter. 

***Theatre of the mind and improvisation.*** Depending on the severity of the DM burnout - and how much this whole insight and possible change will help to alleviate said burnout - I might have to tone down my prep time a bit. I think it starts with battlemaps and combat - as these aspects of preparation are the least interesting to me as a person. They are still important for immersion and narrative purposes, but they do take an immense amount of time to get right and do not necessarily outweigh the enjoyment I get out of them.
This might mean that some combat encounters might be played within the theatre of the mind, or simply using tokens on a plain splash art.
Additionally, some descriptions of locations and/or scenes might need to be improvised rather than fully prepared.

***Support and validation.*** In the end, all the effort that goes into telling stories is worthwhile. I think that even in a vacuum world without words of support, the enjoyment of roleplay and storytelling lives in equilibrium with the effort, doubt and fear that try to push it down. Yes there will be moments of stress and exhaustion, but they coexist with moments of euphoria and bliss as well.
Luckily, we don't live in a world void of appreciation. Words of support from a player mean so much more than they realise. I truly mean that, when players share a highlight or mention their love for a session, can make that enjoyment outweigh the effort and fear twofold. Even things as simple as a laugh, an aghast yelp, recollecting a detail, taking notes, or a thank you help to shatter that equilibrium.

## On a lighter note
So with all that said, I'm convinced I'll find my way out of this. Simply writing this all down and sharing it has helped a ton already - communication is key as per usual.

I think all the above illustrates how much I'm inclined to continue what we're doing. I adore D&D, my players, the story and everything that comes with it.

Ty for reading!
